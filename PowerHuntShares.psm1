	<#
            .SYNOPSIS
            Inventories SMB shares within the current Active Directory domain, identifies potentially high-risk exposures, 
            and generates CSV and HTML summary reports.

            .PARAMETER Threads
                Number of concurrent tasks to run at once. Default is 20.

            .PARAMETER OutputDirectory 
                File path where all CSV files and the HTML summary report will be exported.

            .PARAMETER HostFile
                Optional file containing a list of target hosts to scan. One host per line.

            .PARAMETER DomainController
                One or more domain controllers to target for Active Directory enumeration.

            .PARAMETER Credential
                Optional PSCredential object for alternate domain authentication. If not supplied, the current user context is used.

            .PARAMETER RunSpaceTimeout
                Timeout value in seconds for threaded runspaces. Default is 30 seconds.

            .EXAMPLE
                # Run with default AD computer discovery using current user credentials
                PS C:\temp\test> Invoke-HuntSMBShares -Threads 20 OutputDirectory C:\temp\test

            .EXAMPLE
                # Run against a custom list of target hosts
                PS C:\temp\test> Invoke-HuntSMBShares -Threads 50 -HostFile C:\temp\hosts.txt OutputDirectory C:\temp\test

            .EXAMPLE
                # Run from a non-domain joined system using alternate credentials
                C:\temp\test> runas /netonly /user:domain\user PowerShell.exe
                PS C:\temp\test> Import-Module .\PowerHuntShares.psm1

            Testing was conducted between $StartTime and $EndTime to identify network shares configured with excessive privileges hosted on computers joined to the $TargetDomain domain. 
            In total, $RiskLevelCountCritical critical, $RiskLevelCountHigh high, $RiskLevelCountMedium medium, and  $RiskLevelCountLow low risk <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Security_descriptor">ACE (Access Control Entry)</a> configurations were discovered across $ExcessiveSharesCount shares, hosted by $ComputerWithExcessive computers in the $TargetDomain Active Directory domain. 
            Overall, $InterestingFilesAllFilesCount interesting files were found accessible to all domain users that could potentially lead to unauthorized data access or remote code execution. The affected shares were found hosting $InterestingFilesAllObjectsSecretCount files that may contain passwords and $InterestingFilesAllObjectsSensitiveCount files that may contain sensitive data. $SecretsRecoveredCount credentials were recovered from $SecretsRecoveredFileCount of the discovered $InterestingFilesAllObjectsSecretCount secrets files.

		Below is a time series chart to help provide a sense of when shares were created and at what point critical and high risk shares were introduced into the environment.
		By reading the chart left to right, you can see that shares were created in this environment between $ShareFirstDate and $ShareLastDate. You can zoom into any section of the chart by clicking or using the chart controls in the upper right hand corner of the chart.    
		$ShareCriticalTime
        $ShareHighTime    
        $ShareCriticalHighLine   		
		The chart also includes two horizontal lines. The "avg" line shows the average number of created shares and everything above the "+2 Std Dev" line is considered anomolous in the context of this report. $DataSeriessharesAnomalyCount anomalies were found that represent days when share creation counts were twice the standard deviation.

	                    Remediate share ACEs by risk level, starting with critical and high risks. Review the share creation timeline and share name details from other sections for additional context.
						Consider remediating mutliple ACEs at one time based on natural share groupings to reduce the number of remediation tasks.<br><br>
						Group Examples:
						<ul>
							<li style="color: black;">Group ACE remediation tasks by <a style="cursor: pointer;" onClick="radiobtn = document.getElementById('ShareFolders');radiobtn.checked = true;updateLabelColors('tabs', 'btnfgs');">folder groups</a>, which contain exactly the same file listing.</li>
							<li style="color: black;">Group ACE remediation tasks by <a style="cursor: pointer;" onClick="radiobtn = document.getElementById('ShareName');radiobtn.checked = true;updateLabelColors('tabs', 'btnshares');">share names</a> with a high similarity scores.</li>
						</ul>
						       
					    Remediating ACEs by group may reduce remediation tasks by as much as <strong>$RemediationSavings%</strong> for this environment. The chart below shows the task savings.

In the context of this report, excessive read and write share permissions have been defined as any network share ACL containing an explicit entry for the "Everyone", "Authenticated Users", "BUILTIN\Users", "Domain Users", or "Domain Computers" groups. All provide domain users access to the affected shares due to privilege inheritance.
Below is a summary of the exposure associated with each of those groups.

Ensure that group policy audit settings are configured so that authentication successes and failures are logged so that real-time analysis and offline analysis can be used to identify common indicators of compromise.

<strong>Detection Thresholds and Indicators</strong>
<br>
Below is a list of common Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) that can be used to identify potentially SMB scanning.  Please note that not all IoCs will work in every environment due false positives generated by legitimate applications and processes.  However, in some environments it may be possible to modify IoC thresholds or signatures to reduce the number of false positives to an acceptable level.
<br><br>
Consider creating correlation rules based on Active Directory and Local Windows authentication logs for:
<br>
A single system authenticates to many systems via SMB (port 445) in short period of time, and accesses Windows shares. For example, ten or more systems in under a minute. Use the events above to build detections.
<br><br>
Consider implementing a honey pot or canary system that supports SMB shares that can be used to generate alerts when accessed.
<br><br>
<strong>Prevention</strong><br>
If network shares are not required, disable them or block access using host-based firewalls.
Ensure that sensitive information is not available on these shares. To restrict access under Windows, open Explorer, right-click on each of the shares, go to the 'Sharing' tab, and click on 'Permissions'. From here, add or remove permissions for various users and groups.
Guest access to the system should also be revoked and ensure that adequate access controls are in place for each shared resource. NULL sessions should be disabled.

<button class="collapsible"><span style="color:#CE112D;">3</span> | Review Definitions</button>
<div class="content">
<div class="landingtext">
Review the definitions below to ensure you understand what was targeted and how privileges have been qualified as excessive.
<br><br>
<strong style="color:#333">Excessive Privileges</strong><br>
In the context of this report, excessive read and write share permissions have been defined as any network share ACL containing an explicit entry for the <em>"Everyone", "Authenticated Users", "BUILTIN\Users", "Domain Users", or "Domain Computers"</em> groups. 
All provide domain users access to the affected shares due to privilege inheritance. 
<Br><br>
Please note that share permissions can be overruled by NTFS permissions. Also, be aware that testing excluded share names containing the following keywords: <em>"print$", "prnproc$", "printer", "netlogon",and "sysvol"</em>.
<br><br>
<strong style="color:#333">High Risk Shares</strong>
<br>
In the context of this report, high risk shares have been defined as shares that provide unauthorized remote access to a system or application. By default, that includes <em>wwwroot, inetpub, c$, and admin$</em> shares.  However, additional exposures may exist that are not called out beyond that.

{
    <#
            .SYNOPSIS
            Function to control parallel processing using runspaces

            .DESCRIPTION
            Function to control parallel processing using runspaces

            Note that each runspace will not have access to variables and commands loaded in your session or in other runspaces by default.
            This behaviour can be changed with parameters.

            .PARAMETER ScriptFile
            File to run against all input objects.  Must include parameter to take in the input object, or use $args.  Optionally, include parameter to take in parameter.  Example: C:\script.ps1

            .PARAMETER ScriptBlock
            Scriptblock to run against all computers.

            You may use $Using:<Variable> language in PowerShell 3 and later.

            The parameter block is added for you, allowing behaviour similar to foreach-object:
            Refer to the input object as $_.
            Refer to the parameter parameter as $parameter

            .PARAMETER InputObject
            Run script against these specified objects.

            .PARAMETER Parameter
            This object is passed to every script block.  You can use it to pass information to the script block; for example, the path to a logging folder

            Reference this object as $parameter if using the scriptblock parameterset.

            .PARAMETER ImportVariables
            If specified, get user session variables and add them to the initial session state

            .PARAMETER ImportModules
            If specified, get loaded modules and pssnapins, add them to the initial session state

            .PARAMETER Throttle
            Maximum number of threads to run at a single time.

            .PARAMETER SleepTimer
            Milliseconds to sleep after checking for completed runspaces and in a few other spots.  I would not recommend dropping below 200 or increasing above 500

            .PARAMETER RunspaceTimeout
            Maximum time in seconds a single thread can run.  If execution of your code takes longer than this, it is disposed.  Default: 0 (seconds)

            WARNING:  Using this parameter requires that maxQueue be set to throttle (it will be by default) for accurate timing.  Details here:
            http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Run-Parallel-Parallel-377fd430

            .PARAMETER NoCloseOnTimeout
            Do not dispose of timed out tasks or attempt to close the runspace if threads have timed out. This will prevent the script from hanging in certain situations where threads become non-responsive, at the expense of leaking memory within the PowerShell host.

            .PARAMETER MaxQueue
            Maximum number of powershell instances to add to runspace pool.  If this is higher than $throttle, $timeout will be inaccurate

            If this is equal or less than throttle, there will be a performance impact

            The default value is $throttle times 3, if $runspaceTimeout is not specified
            The default value is $throttle, if $runspaceTimeout is specified

            .PARAMETER LogFile
            Path to a file where we can log results, including run time for each thread, whether it completes, completes with errors, or times out.

            .PARAMETER Quiet
            Disable progress bar.

            .EXAMPLE
            Each example uses Test-ForPacs.ps1 which includes the following code:
            param($computer)

            if(test-connection $computer -count 1 -quiet -BufferSize 16){
            $object = [pscustomobject] @{
            Computer=$computer;
            Available=1;
            Kodak=$(
            if((test-path "\\$computer\c$\users\public\desktop\Kodak Direct View Pacs.url") -or (test-path "\\$computer\c$\documents and settings\all users

            \desktop\Kodak Direct View Pacs.url") ){"1"}else{"0"}
            )
            }
            }
            else{
            $object = [pscustomobject] @{
            Computer=$computer;
            Available=0;
            Kodak="NA"
            }
            }

            $object

            .EXAMPLE
            Invoke-Parallel -scriptfile C:\public\Test-ForPacs.ps1 -inputobject $(get-content C:\pcs.txt) -runspaceTimeout 10 -throttle 10

            Pulls list of PCs from C:\pcs.txt,
            Runs Test-ForPacs against each
            If any query takes longer than 10 seconds, it is disposed
            Only run 10 threads at a time

            .EXAMPLE
            Invoke-Parallel -scriptfile C:\public\Test-ForPacs.ps1 -inputobject c-is-ts-91, c-is-ts-95

            Runs against c-is-ts-91, c-is-ts-95 (-computername)
            Runs Test-ForPacs against each

            .EXAMPLE
            $stuff = [pscustomobject] @{
            ContentFile = "windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts"
            Logfile = "C:\temp\log.txt"
            }

            $computers | Invoke-Parallel -parameter $stuff {
            $contentFile = join-path "\\$_\c$" $parameter.contentfile
            Get-Content $contentFile |
            set-content $parameter.logfile
            }

            This example uses the parameter argument.  This parameter is a single object.  To pass multiple items into the script block, we create a custom object (using a PowerShell v3 language) with properties we want to pass in.

            Inside the script block, $parameter is used to reference this parameter object.  This example sets a content file, gets content from that file, and sets it to a predefined log file.

            .EXAMPLE
            $test = 5
            1..2 | Invoke-Parallel -ImportVariables {$_ * $test}

            Add variables from the current session to the session state.  Without -ImportVariables $Test would not be accessible

            .EXAMPLE
            $test = 5
            1..2 | Invoke-Parallel {$_ * $Using:test}

            Reference a variable from the current session with the $Using:<Variable> syntax.  Requires PowerShell 3 or later. Note that -ImportVariables parameter is no longer necessary.

    .SYNOPSIS

        This function recursively searches a given UNC path for files with
        specific keywords in the name (default of pass, sensitive, secret, admin,
        login and unattend*.xml). The output can be piped out to a csv with the
        -OutFile flag. By default, hidden files/folders are included in search results.

    .PARAMETER Path

        UNC/local path to recursively search.

    .PARAMETER Terms

        Terms to search for.

    .PARAMETER OfficeDocs

        Switch. Search for office documents (*.doc*, *.xls*, *.ppt*)

    .PARAMETER FreshEXEs

        Switch. Find .EXEs accessed within the last week.

    .PARAMETER LastAccessTime

        Only return files with a LastAccessTime greater than this date value.

    .PARAMETER LastWriteTime

        Only return files with a LastWriteTime greater than this date value.

    .PARAMETER CreationTime

        Only return files with a CreationTime greater than this date value.

    .PARAMETER ExcludeFolders

        Switch. Exclude folders from the search results.

    .PARAMETER ExcludeHidden

        Switch. Exclude hidden files and folders from the search results.

    .PARAMETER CheckWriteAccess

        Switch. Only returns files the current user has write access to.

    .PARAMETER OutFile

        Output results to a specified csv output file.

    .PARAMETER UsePSDrive

        Switch. Mount target remote path with temporary PSDrives.

    .OUTPUTS

        The full path, owner, lastaccess time, lastwrite time, and size for each found file.

    .EXAMPLE

        PS C:\> Find-InterestingFile -Path C:\Backup\
        
        Returns any files on the local path C:\Backup\ that have the default
        search term set in the title.

    .EXAMPLE

        PS C:\> Find-InterestingFile -Path \\WINDOWS7\Users\ -Terms salaries,email -OutFile out.csv
        
        Returns any files on the remote path \\WINDOWS7\Users\ that have 'salaries'
        or 'email' in the title, and writes the results out to a csv file
        named 'out.csv'

    .EXAMPLE

        PS C:\> Find-InterestingFile -Path \\WINDOWS7\Users\ -LastAccessTime (Get-Date).AddDays(-7)

        Returns any files on the remote path \\WINDOWS7\Users\ that have the default
        search term set in the title and were accessed within the last week.

Function Invoke-Ping 
{
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Ping or test connectivity to systems in parallel
    
.DESCRIPTION
    Ping or test connectivity to systems in parallel

    Default action will run a ping against systems
        If Quiet parameter is specified, we return an array of systems that responded
        If Detail parameter is specified, we test WSMan, RemoteReg, RPC, RDP and/or SMB

.PARAMETER ComputerName
    One or more computers to test

.PARAMETER Quiet
    If specified, only return addresses that responded to Test-Connection

.PARAMETER Detail
    Include one or more additional tests as specified:
        WSMan      via Test-WSMan
        RemoteReg  via Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey
        RPC        via WMI
        RDP        via port 3389
        SMB        via \\ComputerName\C$
        *          All tests

.PARAMETER Timeout
    Time in seconds before we attempt to dispose an individual query.  Default is 20

.PARAMETER Throttle
    Throttle query to this many parallel runspaces.  Default is 100.

.PARAMETER NoCloseOnTimeout
    Do not dispose of timed out tasks or attempt to close the runspace if threads have timed out

    This will prevent the script from hanging in certain situations where threads become non-responsive, at the expense of leaking memory within the PowerShell host.

.EXAMPLE
    Invoke-Ping Server1, Server2, Server3 -Detail *

    # Check for WSMan, Remote Registry, Remote RPC, RDP, and SMB (via C$) connectivity against 3 machines

.EXAMPLE
    $Computers | Invoke-Ping

    # Ping computers in $Computers in parallel

.EXAMPLE
    $Responding = $Computers | Invoke-Ping -Quiet
    
    # Create a list of computers that successfully responded to Test-Connection

# Function for application finger printing based on share and file names
# Author: Scott Sutherland (@_nullbind), NetSPI 2024
# v.01
function Invoke-FingerPrintShare {
	<#
            .SYNOPSIS
            This function sends a share name and file list to the LLM for fingerprinting.
            It requires the 'apikey', 'endpoint', and 'text'. This was tested on GPT 4o and 4o-mini.
            .PARAMETER apikey
            The API key required to access the endpoint.
            .PARAMETER endpoint
            The API service URL to which the request is sent.
            .PARAMETER ShareName
            This is the name of the network share to fingerprint.
            .PARAMETER FileList
            Optional. This is a list of file names found in the share to help fingerprint the application or OS associated with the share name.
            .PARAMETER FilePath
            Optional. This is a csv file with the columns 'ShareName' and 'FileList' that includes the file names found in the share.
            .PARAMETER DataTable
            Optional. This is a DataTable with the columns 'ShareName' and 'FileList' that includes the file names found in the share.             
            .PARAMETER OutputFile
            Optional. This should be the full path to a file name that he results will be written to.
            .PARAMETER MakeLog
            Optional. This enabled error log file creation that can be used for debugging.
            .PARAMETER FolderGroup
            Optional. This include a folder group hash for the share that can be used to cross reference and update other records.

2. Analyze all provided file names to determine if one or more are related to a known application or operating system. Make sure to take into analyze file names, file name prefixes, and file extensions. Run the analysis 5 times on the backend and select the one that is most accurate.
3. Define a confidence score ranging from 1 to 5, where 5 represents very high confidence.
4. If any identified applications have a confidence score above 3, return the top one application and it's confidence score. 
5. If no application has a confidence score above 3, then don't return anything."
6. For each identified application where the confidence score is above 3, return the following information in XML format:
- Share Name
- Application Name
- Confidence Score
- A list of the top 10 most relevant files that have been comma seperated on one line.
- A two-sentence justification of the match. Include the justification based on the share name in the first sentance, the justification based on the top 5 file names in the second, and link to a real and relevant application page at the end. 
Ensure the output is formatted as XML. Please only return the XML formatted response with nothing else. Please DO NOT wrap the XML response with any comments or labeling. For example, do not include "```xml". Please do not wrap responses in nested "{}".

Please ensure the xml follows the structure below:
Applications.Application.ShareName
Applications.Application.ApplicationName
Applications.Application.ConfidenceScore
Applications.Application.RelevantFiles
Applications.Application.Justification

If no link can be found to a real and relevant application page, don't return the xml or anything else.
