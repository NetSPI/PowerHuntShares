# PowerHuntShares v2

PowerHuntShares is PowerShell tool designed to help cybersecurity teams and penetration testers better identify, understand, attack, and remediate SMB shares in the Active Directory environments they protect. Every hacker has a story about abusing SMB shares, but itâ€™s an attack surface that cybersecurity teams still struggle to defend. This project aims to provide an open proof-of-concept tool for creating a comprehensive share inventory, leveraging statistics, charts, graphs, and language models to contextualize shares, summarize relationships, assess risks, and prioritize remediation.

It supports functionality to:
* <strong>Authenticate</strong> using the current user context, a credential, or clear text user/password.
* <strong>Discover</strong> accessible systems associated with an Active Directory domain automatically. It will also filter Active Directory computers based on available open ports.
* <strong>Target</strong> a single computer, list of computers, or discovered Active Directory computers (default).
* <strong>Collect</strong> SMB share ACL information from target computers using PowerShell.
* <strong>Analyze</strong> collected Share ACL data.
* <strong>Report</strong> summary reports and excessive privilege details in HTML and CSV file formats.

# Vocabulary
PowerHuntShares will inventory SMB share ACLs configured with "excessive privileges" and highlight "high risk" ACLs.  Below is how those are defined in this context.

<strong>Excessive Privileges</strong><br>
Excessive read and write share permissions have been defined as any network share ACL containing an explicit ACE (Access Control Entry) for the "Everyone", "Authenticated Users", "BUILTIN\Users", "Domain Users", or "Domain Computers" groups. All provide domain users access to the affected shares due to privilege inheritance issues.  Note there is a parameter that allow operators to add their own target groups.<br>
Below is some additional background:<br>
* Everyone is a direct reference that applies to both unauthenticated and authenticated users.  Typically only a null session is required to access those resources.
* BUILTIN\Users contains Authenticated Users
* Authenticated Users contains Domain Users on domain joined systems. That's why Domain Users can access a share when the share permissions have been assigned to "BUILTIN\Users".
* Domain Users is a direct reference
* Domain Users can also create up to 10 computer accounts by default that get placed in the Domain Computers group
* Domain Users that have local administrative access to a domain joined computer can also impersonate the computer account. 

Please Note: Share permissions can be overruled by NTFS permissions. Also, be aware that testing excluded share names containing the following keywords: <pre>print$, prnproc$, printer, netlogon,and sysvol</pre>

<strong>High Risk Shares</strong><br>
In the context of this report, high risk shares have been defined as shares that provide unauthorized remote access to a system or application. 
By default, that includes the shares <pre> wwwroot, inetpub, c$, and admin$   </pre>
However, additional exposures may exist that are not called out beyond that.

# Setup Commands
Below is a list of commands that can be used to load PowerHuntShares into your current PowerShell session. Please note that one of these will have to be run each time you run PowerShell is run.  It is not persistent. 
```ps1
# Bypass execution policy restrictions
Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope Process Bypass

# Import module that exists in the current directory
Import-Module .\PowerHuntShares.psm1

or

# Reduce SSL operating level to support connection to github
[System.Net.ServicePointManager]::ServerCertificateValidationCallback = {$true}
[Net.ServicePointManager]::SecurityProtocol =[Net.SecurityProtocolType]::Tls12

# Download and load PowerHuntShares.psm1 into memory
IEX(New-Object System.Net.WebClient).DownloadString("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/NetSPI/PowerHuntShares/main/PowerHuntShares.psm1")
```
# Example Commands
Important Note: All commands should be run as an unprivileged domain user.
```ps1
.EXAMPLE 1: Run from a domain computer. Performs Active Directory computer discovery by default.
PS C:\temp\test> Invoke-HuntSMBShares -Threads 100 -OutputDirectory c:\temp\test 

.EXAMPLE 2: Run from a domain computer with alternative domain credentials. Performs Active Directory computer discovery by default.
PS C:\temp\test> Invoke-HuntSMBShares -Threads 100 -OutputDirectory c:\temp\test -Credential domain\user

.EXAMPLE 3: Run from a domain computer as current user. Target hosts in a file. One per line.
PS C:\temp\test> Invoke-HuntSMBShares -Threads 100 -OutputDirectory c:\temp\test  -HostFile c:\temp\hosts.txt      

.EXAMPLE 4: Run from a non-domain computer with credential. Performs Active Directory computer discovery by default.
C:\temp\test> runas /netonly /user:domain\user PowerShell.exe
PS C:\temp\test> Import-Module PowerHuntShares.psm1
PS C:\temp\test> Invoke-HuntSMBShares -Threads 100 -RunSpaceTimeout 10 -OutputDirectory c:\folder\ -DomainController 10.1.1.1 -Credential domain\user 
```

**Pending Fixes/Bugs**
* Update code to avoid defender
* Password extraction functions current return a "valid" record when the fields are found in the file, but the have blank values. Also, some directories appear to be treated as files.
* ACLs associated with Builtin\Users sometimes shows up as LocalSystem under undefined conditions, and as a result, doesnt show up in the Excessive Privileges export. - Thanks Sam!
 
**Pending Features**
* Add powerhuntshares version to html report output
* Add options to opt out of interesting file enumeration and secrets parsing.
* Add ability to specify additional groups to target
* Add file content search.
* Add DontExcludePrintShares option
* Add auto targeting of groups that contain a large % of the user population; over 70% (make configurable). Add as option. 
* Add configuration fid:
 netlogon and sysvol you may get access denied when using windows 10 unless the setting below is configured. Automat a check for this, and attempt to modify if privs are at correct level. gpedit.msc, go to Computer -> Administrative Templates -> Network -> Network Provider -> Hardened UNC Paths, enable the policy and click "Show" button. Enter your server name (* for all servers) into "Value name" and enter the folowing text "RequireMutualAuthentication=0,RequireIntegrity=0,RequirePrivacy=0" wihtout quotes into the "Value" field. 
* Add active sessions data to help identify potential owners/users of share.
* Pull spns and computer description/spn account descriptions to help identify owner/business unit.
* Create bloodhound import file / edge (highrisk share)
* Add better support for IPv6, IPv6 addresses dont show up in subnets summary
* Dynamic identification of spikes in high risk share creation/common groupings, need to better summarize supporting detail beyond just the timeline. For each of the data insights, add average number of shares created for insight grouping by year/month (for folder hash / name etc), and the increase the month/year it spikes. (attempt to provide some historical context); maybe even list the most common non default directories being used by each of those. Potentially adding "first seen date" as well. (in alpha)
* Dynamic identification of share creation, modification, and access cadence across a share population that share a name and have a high similarity level.
* add showing share permissions (along with the already displayed NTFS permissions) and resultant access (most restrictive wins)
* add depth, file/directory flag
* So. Many. Other. Things.
