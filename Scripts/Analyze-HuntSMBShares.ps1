                     The chart below illustrates the relationship between networks, computers, shares, and the ACEs configured with excessive privileges. Each network contains computers with assigned IP addresses. Each computer may host multiple shares and each share is configured with ACEs that allow remote access. As a result, ACEs represent the individual points of remediation that will need to be addressed to reduce exposure and risk.

Consider reviewing the share creation timeline and data details from the other sections for additional context. Next, prioritize remediating groups of shares to speed up the process. Prioritize by folder group (shares containing exactly the same files) or by share names that have a high similarity score. 
						<i>Prioritizing those groups may help reduce remediation actions by as much as <strong>$RemediationSavings percent</strong> for this environment</i>. Below is a summary of the potential task reduction for each approach.

A a result, the number of visible shares should be (at a minimum) double the number of the computers found with port 445 open.

Folder groups are SMB shares that contain the exact same file listing. Each folder group has been hashed so they can be quickly correlated. In some cases, shares with the exact same file listing may be related to a single application or process.  This information can help identify the root cause associated with the excessive privileges and expedite remediation.

Ensure that group policy audit settings are configured so that authentication successes and failures are logged so that real-time analysis and offline analysis can be used to identify common indicators of compromise.

<strong>Detection Thresholds and Indicators</strong>
<br>
Below is a list of common Indicators of Compromise (IoCs) that can be used to identify potentially SMB scanning.  Please note that not all IoCs will work in every environment due false positives generated by legitimate applications and processes.  However, in some environments it may be possible to modify IoC thresholds or signatures to reduce the number of false positives to an acceptable level.
<br><br>
Consider creating correlation rules based on Active Directory and Local Windows authentication logs for:
<br>
A single system authenticates to many systems via SMB (port 445) in short period of time, and accesses Windows shares. For example, ten or more systems in under a minute. Use the events above to build detections.
<br><br>
Consider implementing a honey pot or canary system that supports SMB shares that can be used to generate alerts when accessed.
<br><br>
<strong>Prevention</strong><br>
If network shares are not required, disable them or block access using host-based firewalls.
Ensure that sensitive information is not available on these shares. To restrict access under Windows, open Explorer, right-click on each of the shares, go to the 'Sharing' tab, and click on 'Permissions'. From here, add or remove permissions for various users and groups.
Guest access to the system should also be revoked and ensure that adequate access controls are in place for each shared resource. NULL sessions should be disabled.

# Notes: Added "ImportSessionFunctions" to import custom functions from the current session into the runspace pool.
function Invoke-Parallel
{
    <#
            .SYNOPSIS
            Function to control parallel processing using runspaces

            .DESCRIPTION
            Function to control parallel processing using runspaces

            Note that each runspace will not have access to variables and commands loaded in your session or in other runspaces by default.
            This behaviour can be changed with parameters.

            .PARAMETER ScriptFile
            File to run against all input objects.  Must include parameter to take in the input object, or use $args.  Optionally, include parameter to take in parameter.  Example: C:\script.ps1

            .PARAMETER ScriptBlock
            Scriptblock to run against all computers.

            You may use $Using:<Variable> language in PowerShell 3 and later.

            The parameter block is added for you, allowing behaviour similar to foreach-object:
            Refer to the input object as $_.
            Refer to the parameter parameter as $parameter

            .PARAMETER InputObject
            Run script against these specified objects.

            .PARAMETER Parameter
            This object is passed to every script block.  You can use it to pass information to the script block; for example, the path to a logging folder

            Reference this object as $parameter if using the scriptblock parameterset.

            .PARAMETER ImportVariables
            If specified, get user session variables and add them to the initial session state

            .PARAMETER ImportModules
            If specified, get loaded modules and pssnapins, add them to the initial session state

            .PARAMETER Throttle
            Maximum number of threads to run at a single time.

            .PARAMETER SleepTimer
            Milliseconds to sleep after checking for completed runspaces and in a few other spots.  I would not recommend dropping below 200 or increasing above 500

            .PARAMETER RunspaceTimeout
            Maximum time in seconds a single thread can run.  If execution of your code takes longer than this, it is disposed.  Default: 0 (seconds)

            WARNING:  Using this parameter requires that maxQueue be set to throttle (it will be by default) for accurate timing.  Details here:
            http://gallery.technet.microsoft.com/Run-Parallel-Parallel-377fd430

            .PARAMETER NoCloseOnTimeout
            Do not dispose of timed out tasks or attempt to close the runspace if threads have timed out. This will prevent the script from hanging in certain situations where threads become non-responsive, at the expense of leaking memory within the PowerShell host.

            .PARAMETER MaxQueue
            Maximum number of powershell instances to add to runspace pool.  If this is higher than $throttle, $timeout will be inaccurate

            If this is equal or less than throttle, there will be a performance impact

            The default value is $throttle times 3, if $runspaceTimeout is not specified
            The default value is $throttle, if $runspaceTimeout is specified

            .PARAMETER LogFile
            Path to a file where we can log results, including run time for each thread, whether it completes, completes with errors, or times out.

            .PARAMETER Quiet
            Disable progress bar.

            .EXAMPLE
            Each example uses Test-ForPacs.ps1 which includes the following code:
            param($computer)

            if(test-connection $computer -count 1 -quiet -BufferSize 16){
            $object = [pscustomobject] @{
            Computer=$computer;

            Invoke-Parallel -scriptfile C:\public\Test-ForPacs.ps1 -inputobject $(get-content C:\pcs.txt) -runspaceTimeout 10 -throttle 10

            Pulls list of PCs from C:\pcs.txt,
            Runs Test-ForPacs against each
            If any query takes longer than 10 seconds, it is disposed
            Only run 10 threads at a time

            .EXAMPLE
            Invoke-Parallel -scriptfile C:\public\Test-ForPacs.ps1 -inputobject c-is-ts-91, c-is-ts-95

            Runs against c-is-ts-91, c-is-ts-95 (-computername)
            Runs Test-ForPacs against each

            .EXAMPLE
            $stuff = [pscustomobject] @{
            ContentFile = "windows\system32\drivers\etc\hosts"
            Logfile = "C:\temp\log.txt"
            }

            $computers | Invoke-Parallel -parameter $stuff {
            $contentFile = join-path "\\$_\c$" $parameter.contentfile
            Get-Content $contentFile |
            set-content $parameter.logfile
            }

            This example uses the parameter argument.  This parameter is a single object.  To pass multiple items into the script block, we create a custom object (using a PowerShell v3 language) with properties we want to pass in.

            Inside the script block, $parameter is used to reference this parameter object.  This example sets a content file, gets content from that file, and sets it to a predefined log file.

            .EXAMPLE
            $test = 5
            1..2 | Invoke-Parallel -ImportVariables {$_ * $test}

            Add variables from the current session to the session state.  Without -ImportVariables $Test would not be accessible

            .EXAMPLE
            $test = 5
            1..2 | Invoke-Parallel {$_ * $Using:test}

            Reference a variable from the current session with the $Using:<Variable> syntax.  Requires PowerShell 3 or later. Note that -ImportVariables parameter is no longer necessary.

    .SYNOPSIS

        This function recursively searches a given UNC path for files with
        specific keywords in the name (default of pass, sensitive, secret, admin,
        login and unattend*.xml). The output can be piped out to a csv with the
        -OutFile flag. By default, hidden files/folders are included in search results.

    .PARAMETER Path

        UNC/local path to recursively search.

    .PARAMETER Terms

        Terms to search for.

    .PARAMETER OfficeDocs

        Switch. Search for office documents (*.doc*, *.xls*, *.ppt*)

    .PARAMETER FreshEXEs

        Switch. Find .EXEs accessed within the last week.

    .PARAMETER LastAccessTime

        Only return files with a LastAccessTime greater than this date value.

    .PARAMETER LastWriteTime

        Only return files with a LastWriteTime greater than this date value.

    .PARAMETER CreationTime

        Only return files with a CreationTime greater than this date value.

    .PARAMETER ExcludeFolders

        Switch. Exclude folders from the search results.

    .PARAMETER ExcludeHidden

        Switch. Exclude hidden files and folders from the search results.

    .PARAMETER CheckWriteAccess

        Switch. Only returns files the current user has write access to.

    .PARAMETER OutFile

        Output results to a specified csv output file.

    .PARAMETER UsePSDrive

        Switch. Mount target remote path with temporary PSDrives.

    .OUTPUTS

        The full path, owner, lastaccess time, lastwrite time, and size for each found file.

    .EXAMPLE

        PS C:\> Find-InterestingFile -Path C:\Backup\
        
        Returns any files on the local path C:\Backup\ that have the default
        search term set in the title.

    .EXAMPLE

        PS C:\> Find-InterestingFile -Path \\WINDOWS7\Users\ -Terms salaries,email -OutFile out.csv
        
        Returns any files on the remote path \\WINDOWS7\Users\ that have 'salaries'
        or 'email' in the title, and writes the results out to a csv file
        named 'out.csv'

    .EXAMPLE

        PS C:\> Find-InterestingFile -Path \\WINDOWS7\Users\ -LastAccessTime (Get-Date).AddDays(-7)

        Returns any files on the remote path \\WINDOWS7\Users\ that have the default
        search term set in the title and were accessed within the last week.

Function Invoke-Ping 
{
<#
.SYNOPSIS
    Ping or test connectivity to systems in parallel
    
.DESCRIPTION
    Ping or test connectivity to systems in parallel

    Default action will run a ping against systems
        If Quiet parameter is specified, we return an array of systems that responded
        If Detail parameter is specified, we test WSMan, RemoteReg, RPC, RDP and/or SMB

.PARAMETER ComputerName
    One or more computers to test

.PARAMETER Quiet
    If specified, only return addresses that responded to Test-Connection

.PARAMETER Detail
    Include one or more additional tests as specified:
        WSMan      via Test-WSMan
        RemoteReg  via Microsoft.Win32.RegistryKey
        RPC        via WMI
        RDP        via port 3389
        SMB        via \\ComputerName\C$
        *          All tests

.PARAMETER Timeout
    Time in seconds before we attempt to dispose an individual query.  Default is 20

.PARAMETER Throttle
    Throttle query to this many parallel runspaces.  Default is 100.

.PARAMETER NoCloseOnTimeout
    Do not dispose of timed out tasks or attempt to close the runspace if threads have timed out

    This will prevent the script from hanging in certain situations where threads become non-responsive, at the expense of leaking memory within the PowerShell host.

.EXAMPLE
    Invoke-Ping Server1, Server2, Server3 -Detail *

    # Check for WSMan, Remote Registry, Remote RPC, RDP, and SMB (via C$) connectivity against 3 machines

.EXAMPLE
    $Computers | Invoke-Ping

    # Ping computers in $Computers in parallel

.EXAMPLE
    $Responding = $Computers | Invoke-Ping -Quiet
    
    # Create a list of computers that successfully responded to Test-Connection
